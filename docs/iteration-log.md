# Iteration Log: Frontend Build Verification Agent

Records each run of the workflow defined in `docs/prd.md`, scored against
`docs/rubric.md`.

| Run ID | Date | Agent/Tool | Prompt/Command Used | Cycle Time | Rubric Scores (1-4 each) | Pass/Fail | Review Latency | Cost | Observations |
|--------|------|------------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------|------|--------------|
| 001 | 2026-08-25 | Claude Code (`claude -p --allowedTools="Bash" --output-format json`) in container `quality-agent`, image `agent-sandbox:fashionmate` | Prompt 001 (see below) | 16.03s | Execution Fidelity: 3, Verdict Accuracy: 3, Evidence Quality: 3, Scope Compliance: 4, Recommendation Quality: 3 | **PASS** (all dimensions >= 3) | Reviewed immediately after run completion; not separately instrumented | $0.0273 (4 input / 713 output / 69,024 cache-read tokens) | Build genuinely fails in this environment: `Cannot find module '@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu'`, a known npm optional-dependency bug (npm/cli#4828), not a source defect. Agent quoted the real error, correctly diagnosed the cause, ran only the authorized command, and proactively asked before running the standard `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` remediation instead of just doing it or silently giving up. `git status` confirmed zero files touched. |
| 002 | TBD | Claude Code (`claude -p`) in `agent-sandbox:fashionmate` | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Iteration after one prompt change -- not yet executed. |

## Prompt 001 (baseline)

> Run this repo's frontend production build. From fashionmate-frontend/fashion-app, run
> npm run build. Report whether the build succeeds, summarize any errors or warnings in
> the output, and recommend whether the frontend is ready for the next step. Do not
> modify any file, do not run npm install with --save or --force, and do not push,
> publish, or deploy anything.
